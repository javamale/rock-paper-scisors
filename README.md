# rock-paper-scissors-simulator
I saw this concept on TikTok and decided to implement it myself. You can simulate the battle of rock paper and scissors from 3 objects to 1000 objects.

I used Unity 2021.3.12f1 to make the game and I made almost all of the assets. Down below you can find source code and references to the assets I used.
